# Qualcomm Linux Memory Skills

AI-powered memory accounting and analysis framework for Qualcomm Linux SoCs.
Designed to be used through natural language prompts to an AI agent (Cline, Cursor, etc.).
Runs entirely from the **host machine** — no installation required on the target device.

**Supported devices:** Qualcomm Linux (QLI) devices

**Supported transports:** ADB (primary) · SSH (secondary)

**Supported host platforms:** Windows · Linux

---

## Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
See [TRANSPORT.md](TRANSPORT.md) for ADB/SSH setup.

### Your First Analysis
```bash
# Step 1: Connect device
adb devices

# Step 2: Tell the agent
"Give me a memory report for the connected device"

# Step 3: View report
# Open results/snapshot_<timestamp>/reports/snapshot_report.html
```

### Common Tasks

| Task | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Memory report | `"Give me a memory report for device <serial>"` |
| Compare vs baseline | `"Compare device against results/baseline/"` |
| Measure use-case (preset) | `"How much memory does the camera use?"` |
| Measure user-launched use-case | `"I want to measure memory of a use-case I'll launch manually"` |
| Measure user-launched (clean baseline) | `"Measure memory of my use-case — reboot first for a clean baseline"` |
| Offline compare | `"Compare results/build_v2/ against results/build_v1/"` |

See [Analysis Modes](#analysis-modes) below for detailed instructions.

## Analysis Modes

**Skill:** `skills/memory-analysis/SKILL.md`

One unified skill with four modes — auto-detected from the parameters you provide.

### Mode 1: Snapshot
Single memory snapshot from a connected device. No baseline required.

```
Device → Collect → Memory Breakdown → snapshot_report.html
```

**Example prompts:**
```
"Give me a memory report for the connected device"
"What is the memory usage on this board?"
"Show me the memory breakdown for device 0426df75"
"Memory report for device at 192.168.1.100, user=root"
```

---

### Mode 2: Workload Impact
Measure the memory footprint of a specific workload.
Collects idle baseline, runs the workload, then compares.

```
Device (idle) → Collect Baseline → Start Workload → Wait 15s
             → Collect Active → Compare → workload_impact_report.html
```

**Step 1** — Add your workload to `skills/memory-analysis/usecases/presets.json`:
```json
"my_workload": {
  "name": "My Workload",
  "description": "What this does",
  "setup": ["systemctl start cam-server", "sleep 3"],
  "command": "the command to run on the device",
  "wait_sec": 15,
  "teardown": ["pkill myapp"]
}
```

**Step 2** — Tell the agent:
```
"How much memory does the camera use?"
"Measure memory impact of camera_h264_encoding"
"Run the camera and tell me the memory impact"
"Measure memory impact of: gst-launch-1.0 qtiqmmfsrc ..."
```

---

### Mode 3: Regression Test
Compare a connected device against a pre-collected reference snapshot.

```
Live Device + Pre-collected Reference → Compare → regression_report.html
```

**Example prompts:**
```
"Is this device using more memory than the reference?"
"Compare device 0426df75 against the golden baseline in results/golden/"
"Regression test: collect from device and compare with results/build_v1/"
```

---

### Mode 4: Snapshot Comparison (Offline)
Compare two previously collected snapshots — no device required.

```
Snapshot A + Snapshot B → Compare → comparison_report.html
```

**Example prompts:**
```
"Compare results/build_v2/ against results/build_v1/"
"Offline comparison: current=results/camera_active/ reference=results/baseline/"
"Compare two snapshots: A=data/device_A/ B=data/device_B/"
```

---

## Tell the agent

Connect your device and describe the task in plain English.
The agent will use the `memory-analysis` skill and auto-detect the appropriate mode.

### Transport Selection

The agent will ask you to choose a transport if it cannot auto-detect:

**ADB (primary — Qualcomm Linux devices):**
```
Connect USB cable → adb devices → tell the agent the serial number
```
If multiple devices are connected, the agent will list them and ask you to select one.

**SSH (secondary — any Linux device):**
```
Tell the agent: "use SSH, device at 192.168.1.100, user=root"
```
The agent will prompt for hostname, username, and password.

### What the AI agent will ask you

If information is missing, the agent will ask:
- **"Which transport? ADB or SSH?"** (if ADB is not available or multiple devices are connected)
- **"Which device?"** (if multiple ADB devices are connected — shows list to select from)
- **"SSH hostname, username, and password?"** (if SSH transport is selected)
- **"What command should I run on the device?"** (for use-case mode)
- **"Where is the reference snapshot?"** (for compare modes)
- **"How long should I wait for the use-case to stabilize?"** (default: 15s)

## Requirements & Compatibility

### Host Machine

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Python 3.10+** | Required for all scripts — `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| **ADB** | Optional — required only for ADB transport (Qualcomm Linux devices) |
| **paramiko** | Optional — required only for SSH transport (`pip install paramiko`) |

### Qualcomm-Specific Features

These features are **only available on Qualcomm Linux devices**:
- KGSL GPU memory tracking
- NHLOS carveout breakdown
- `procrank` process memory ranking

On generic Linux (via SSH), these features are unavailable but basic memory accounting (Total RAM, Kernel, Userspace, DMA-BUF) still works.

| Feature | Qualcomm Linux | Generic Linux (SSH) |
|---|---|---|
| Total RAM, Kernel, Userspace | ✅ | ✅ |
| DMA-BUF by allocator | ✅ | ✅ (if debugfs available) |
| KGSL GPU memory | ✅ | ❌ |
| NHLOS carveout breakdown | ✅ | ❌ |
| Per-process PSS | ✅ (procrank) | ✅ (smaps_rollup) |
